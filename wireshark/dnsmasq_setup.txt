======================
Dnsmasq setup:
======================
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved

Edit the /etc/resolv.conf file to contain the following entry:
nameserver 8.8.8.8

Now install dnsmasq
sudo apt install dnsmasq

uncomment these lines:
port=53
domain-needed
bogus-priv
no-resolv

Add your domains below the no-resolv line:
address=/r1.home.com/10.1.1.254
address=/myrouter.home.com/10.1.1.254

Set your public server to Google for example:
server=8.8.8.8
